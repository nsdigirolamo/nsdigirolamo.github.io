# Nicholas DiGirolamo

Welcome to my website. I'm a Computer Science undergrad at the
University of Delaware with a concentration in Systems and Networks.
I'm also currently an incoming TDP Software Engineer at GEICO. My
pronouns are he/him.

I'm going to be using this site as a place to show off my personal projects,
to hold research for potential future projects, and to archive cool things I
find on the internet.
